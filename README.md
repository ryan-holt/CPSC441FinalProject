# CPSC 441 Final Project Instructions

To run this project, please have the RAC set up. The setup involves having a master, slave, client and administrator client.
* The master is the 'server' of the application that gathers survey results and instructs the slaves on what to do.
* The slaves are individual systems that perform the required computations as instructed by the master.
* The client fills in survey questions for analysis.
* The administrator client has extended privileges to trigger correlation calculations, view and list historical correlation data.

To run the project on the RAC:
1. Please set up the 'slave' machine of the application. The slave application must be run before the master or client runs.
2. Once the slave starts running, you can run the master.
3. Please run the client and administrator at this time (in no particular order).
4. Once the client starts, please enter your name.
5. A survey will appear. Please enter the the survey answers, delimited by a space.
6. On the client administrator, please enter the name as 'admin'. Then you will have administrator options to control the application.
